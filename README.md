With guest - @[appboy] (https://github.com/human-caching)
- Install Atom and Teletype package
- Share portal; 
- Set up simple fun project to get "Dad's jokes" using Node.js, express.js, axios.js (HTTP client that makes asychronous promise-based requests to Node.js)
       
To try this simple project:
#### MAKE SURE YOU HAVE Node.js installed.  Please see https://nodejs.dev/learn/how-to-install-nodejs for details if you have not already done so.
       
- npm init
      
- npm install
       
- npm start
       
Then open up a browser:
- http://localhost:8080/joke
       
  What to expect:
       A JSON object in a string, for example -
            {"id":"hyPmOZLBIBd","joke":"I used to work for a soft drink can crusher. It was soda pressing.","status":200}
