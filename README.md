     * Install Atom and Teletype package
     * Share portal; 
     * Set up simple fun project to get "Dad's jokes" using Node.js, express.js, axios.js (HTTP client that makes asychronous promise-based requests to Node.js)
       
       To try this simple project:
       > npm install
       > npm start
       
       Then open up a browser:
       > http://localhost:8080/joke
       
       What to expect:
       A json object, for example -
            {"id":"hyPmOZLBIBd","joke":"I used to work for a soft drink can crusher. It was soda pressing.","status":200}
